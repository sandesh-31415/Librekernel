## Can u define the project in a line here ?
example: Open source, free of blobls router/firewall. 

## Is there are any similar projects like this ?
if yes mention it and define what is the new in ur project , if no remark that you are the first one doing this.

## is their any demo showing that it is acutally did what is calimed ?

#Why do we need this technology?

- **Sniffers**: those that are checking your traffic.
- **Government spy/monitoring institutions passive actions**: collecting general data from worldwide.
- **Librerouter evil nodes**:  a box Owned for those _bad people_.
- **Malicious internet nodes**: better known as _blackbones_.
- **Your internet provider (ISP)**: if they would trying anything with your data.

The Internet is full of ___free___ services and you are the product they sell your data, in their _terms and conditions page_, that ***almost nobody reads***, and **Librerouter** operates exactly the opposite:

# WTH is stands for ?

#WTH is Linux-libre?

Is an operating system kernel and a GNU package[3] that is maintained from modified versions of the Linux kernel. The aim of the project is to remove from the Linux kernel any software that does not include its source code, has its source code obfuscated, or is released under proprietary licenses.

Software components with no available source code are called binary blobs and, as such, are mostly used for proprietary firmware images in the Linux kernel. While generally redistributable, binary blobs do not give the user the freedom to audit, modify or, consequently, redistribute their modified versions.

### 2 ways to have Linux with no blobs:
- a) Deblobing : clean up and verify linux tarballs and patches for non-Free blobs, you can check if your linux tarballs has non-free blobs or not from [here](http://www.fsfla.org/svn/fsfla/software/linux-libre/scripts/deblob-check)
- b) Use clean basement and dont allow instaltion of 3rd party software that is stablished by trust control is free of blobls. Example [linux libre](http://www.linux-libre.fsfla.org/pub/linux-libre/releases/LATEST-4.6.N/)
  

#WTH is Open-source hardware ?
Yes, it is.
It consists of physical artifacts of technology designed and offered by the open design movement. Both free and open-source software (FOSS) as well as open-source hardware is created by this open-source culture movement and applies a like concept to a variety of components. It is sometimes, thus, referred to as FOSH (free and open-source hardware). The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it - coupling it closely to the maker movement.[1] Hardware design (i.e. mechanical drawings, schematics, bills of material, PCB layout data, HDL source code[2] and integrated circuit layout data), in addition to the software that drives the hardware, are all released under free/libre terms. The original sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community. There is now significant evidence that such sharing can drive a high return on investment for investors.


###LGPL

The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a free software license published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate software released under the LGPL into their own (even proprietary) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components. The license only requires software under the LGPL be modifiable by end users via source code availability. For proprietary software, code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library such as a DLL, so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components. The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries, although it is also used by some stand-alone applications.

###CC

A Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. A CC license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they have created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, they might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of their own work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work.

#WTH many claimed they are open hardware but it is bullshit?

The market is full of crowdfunded project where the funder claimed the project is open hardware but in real the hardware is full of binary blobls, chipset restringtions and questions about missing parts of info and doc:

- ARM Truszone
- Controllers in Chipset of the network nics is not opensource
- No source code.
- Binary Blobs in the ROMs or bROM.
- No documentation-
- No schematics
- Neeed sign binary for bein accepted by the board.
- Not accept free booting.

##Service Descentralized Indestructible Storage the RockStar app

Imagine all the important information you have stored on the hard drive of your computer.You are just one hardware failure away from disaster.After all, when did you do your last backup? Unfortunately, centralized storage solutions such as Dropbox and Google Drive also present a variety of risks:

• Data kidnapping: A real example was Mega. (FBI closed it in 2009). 
• Disaster: Your external hard disks fail or stolen. (no disaster recovery)   
• Privacy: You're at risk of having your data hacked and stolen if it’s not encrypted.

![gridstorage](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13025157/14445990/c11a4172-0051-11e6-93f8-23a53225b479.jpg)

The decentralized (i2p) version of Tahoe LAFS-Grid (with protections against Sybil attacks and upload Dodos) is a new way to make your data indestructible. A grid splits your files up into little pieces, encrypts them and spreads them out geographically, making it immune to any disaster or service outage.
In our decentralized system your valuable information is encrypted three times:
1. Before it even leaves your computer, in the web browser
2. In the collaboration tool before the data goes to the hard disk
3. When backing up to the grid, the slices will also be encrypted. 


![tahoe](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13025157/14444761/fea4bc0c-0047-11e6-80bd-583bcb7b0fda.jpg)

You can also sync your home Librerouter with all of your portable devices to have the same files and receive the same alerts in real time.If someone steals your cube or for some reason it is destroyed, you can simply buy a replacement Librerouter server and recover your lost data automatically from the Grid.In minutes you’re up and running again!

## Service The descentralized Social networkNetwork

Librerouter can act as a unified entry and outgoing point for all of your posts across social networks, as well as a filter for what is important to you.For example, do you hate cat videos? (Really? Can I get you some help?)
You can use Librerouter to filter them out when it automatically imports posts from Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest!
You control your incoming and outgoing posts, and push your posts from a single place to everywhere with no need to open each social network in a separate tab.We aren’t asking you to give up on social media.Instead we offer you a way to be in the captain’s chair.

## Service The descentralized Video Conference

With federated XMPP servers for authentication but perfect for discovering users outside the Librerouter network with security from the normal web.  b) Unauthenticated and decentralized web browser video conferencing through anonymous links to create fast video conference rooms without third parties or middlemen involved.

#Setup Modes
<!-- this part needs to be refactored by someone that does know the current state of building process -->
There are 2 ways to join to CommunityLibrerouter network

###1. Setup CommunityLibrerouter software on Physical/Virtual machine----Debian or librekernel distro
###2. Setup CommunityLibrerouter software on ARM-------------------------Debian or librekernel distro croscompiled

The following list includes some of the features that have been added and modified in the Linux kernel (core):

• Anti-exploitation modules high tuned for OS attacking resistance.   
• Anti-forensic capabilities in the case of seizure by law enforcement. 
• Cryptographically enhanced modules for file memory and access modes. Boot and Full disk encryption and Cold Boot Attack patched. 
• Isolation: Each service runs in an isolated environment, to prevent security bugs that may affect the rest of the system and services. 
• Optimization: Proper service configuration helps to avoid possible vector attacks of unused libraries. 
• Backward/downward compatible: New security standards can receive, read, view or play older standards or formats.

##Steps to setup on Physical/Virtual machine.

**Step 1: Checking requirements**
Your Physical/Virtual machine need to meet the minimum requirements:
 - 1. x2 network interfaceS
 - 2. 1 GB of RAM
 - 3. 16 GB of SD or micro SD or virtual booting HD
 - 4. SATA HARDDISK or separate second phzsical or virutual DISK

The way networking works in Librerouter will be:

2 Bridges two interfaces each
 - 1x bridge acts as a WAN
 - 2st bridge acts as LAN

So, we actually have 4 possible PHySICAL scenarios:

 - WAN is WiFi, LAN is WiFi
 - WAN is WiFi, LAN is Cabled Ethernet
 - WAN is Cabled Ethernet, LAN is WiFi
 - WAN is Cabled Ethernet, LAN is Cabled Ethernet

**Step 2: Setup the network.**

In this step you need to connect one interface of your machine to Internet, and other one to local network device.
Networking of Librerouter has two way to work.



##Server mode**

The way networking works in Librerouter will be:

 -  -1 uniqe fix IP LAN or Bridge> can be WLAN or Cabled Ethernett connected to the existing internet router LAN. Server mode with single LAN interface and not redirecting domains or threating the traffic (not hable to defend against web browsing leaks and malware)

##Bridge mode**

Where the trafic is filtered by dns, and by proxy squid with clamav and ssl bumping, and surikata. Also redirecting dns via TOR and dnssec)

#Step 3. Executing scripts.


In this step you need to download and execute the following scripts on your machine with given order.

 - 1. app-installation-script.sh
 - 2. app-configuration-script.sh
 - 3. app-post configuiration encryption FDE fill disk en cryption
 - 4. Minimun System Wizards
 - 5. Subsystems GUIs

![initial-install-workflow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13025157/14444383/5b99d710-0045-11e6-9ae8-3efa1645f355.png)

 - Step 1. Checking user
The script should be run by user root, if it was run by another user then it will warn and exit.

 - Step 2. Checking Platform
The all software intended to run on Debian 7/8 or Ubuntu 12.04/14.04, so if script finds another platform it will output an error and exit.

 - Step 3. Checking Hardware
As software can be installed either on odroid or Physical/Virtual machine, in this step we need to determine hardware. If script runs on odroid it should find Processor = ARM Hardware = XU3 or XU4 or C1+ or C2 If script runs on Physical/Virtual machine it should fine Processor = Intel After determining hardware type we can determine the next step.
If hardware is Physical/Virtual machine

 - Step 4. Checking requirements
There are a list of minimum requirements that Physical/Virtual machine needs to meet.
    2 network interfaces (ethernet or wlan)
    1 GB of Physical memory
    16 GB of Free disk space
If machine meets the requirements then script goes to next step, otherwise it will warn and exit.

 - Step 5. Getting DHCP client on interfaces
In this step script first DHCP request from eth1 to get an ip address. If succeed, it will check for Internet connection and if Internet connection is established this step is done successfully. In any case of failure (no DHCP response or on Internet connection) script will try the same scenario for next interface. Order to try is - eth1, wlan1, eth0, wlan0 (list of available interfaces are available from step 4).
Of no success in any interface, then script will warn user to plug the machine to Internet and will exit.

 - Step 6. Preparing repositories and updating sources
In this step script adds repository links for necessary packages into package manager sources and updates them. Script will output an error ant exit if it is not possible to add repositories or update sources.

 - Step 7. Downloading and Installing packages
As we already have repository sources updated in step 6, so at this point script will download and install packages using package manager tools. If something goes wrong during download or installation, script will output an error ant exit.
If step 7 finished successfully then test.sh execution for Physical/Virtual machine is finished successfully and it's time to run the next script “app-installation-script.sh”.
If hardware is odroid board

 - Step 4.2. Check if the board assembled.
There are list of modules that need to be connected to odroid board, so script will check if that modules are connected.
You can fine information about necessary modules here
If any module is missed user will get warning and script will exit.

 - Step 5.2. Configuring bridge interfaces.
In this step script will configure 2 bridge interfaces br0 and br1.
    eth0 and wlan0 will be bridged into interface br0
    eth1 and wlan1 will be bridged into interface br1
In ethernet network, br0 should be connected to Internet and br0 to local network. In wireless network, bridge interdace with wore powerful wlan will be connected to Internet and other one to local network.
After configuring bridge interfaces script will enable dhcp chient on external network interface and set static ip address 10.0.0.1/8 in internal network interface, and then check the Internet connection.
If everything goes fine it will process to next step, otherwise will warn the user to plug the machine to Internet and exit.

 - Step 6.2. Preparing repositories and updating sources
The same as in Physical/Virtual machine case.

 - Step 7.2. Downloading and Installing packages
The same as in Physical/Virtual machine case.
If step 7 finished successfully then test.sh execution for odroid board is finished successfully and it's time to run the next script “app-installation-script.sh”.

#Network Flow

####DNS Resolution Explained

Librerouter needs a powerfull DNS resolver to provide a transparent browsing for the user but it need to be outside the centrilzed mafioso models like IANA.
![part_1_4_dns](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17382786/14854168/e37aa830-0c8e-11e6-8ff4-05eddebf200e.png)

#DNS petitions are processed in this way:

- Regular webpages (ex: www.meneame.net) would need to be resolved by decentralized DNS engine like DjDNS. If it can not resolve then we need to ask TOR about but using DNSCRYPT and using services like DIana or Open NIC

- Onion domains are resolved to a IP inside range 10.192.0.0/16

- I2P domains are always resolved to 10.191.0.1

- Local defined domains, forwards to 10.0.0.1

- Service replacement (ex: google.com it's replaced by our internal service YaCy) will resolve local ip 10.0.0.25x

- Petition Flow: If it's a local service (10.0.0.25x) petition it's forwarded to local Nginx server

![dns](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17382786/14493566/5ebfcba6-0186-11e6-9c0d-e6032290dcc0.png)

Workflow of app-configuration-script.sh
Part 1/4: DNS Resolution

This documentation aims to describe DNS resolution process of LibreRouter.
There are 3 different DNS servers (Unbound Tor and DjDNS) on LibreRouter that work together us one DNS resolution system, to provide the best open source solutions for anonymity and security.  
Here is the list of servers and interfaces/ports DNS servers  are listening.
Unbound is running on 10.0.0.1:53
Tor is running on 10.0.0.1:9053
DjDNS running on 10.0.0.1:8053
At first any DNS request comes to Unbound, which is the main dns server, then if needed unbound will forward the request to Tor or DjDNS. 
Lets describe DNS resolution steps in more details. (Please see DNS resolution picture).

Step: 1 Classified domains resolution
We have integrated shallalist domains list into unbound, so when DNS request comes at first unbound will check if it’s classified. Classified domain are going to be resolved to local services ip addresses or be blocked.
Here is the list of domains
1.	Chat domains – these domains are going to be resolved to IP address 10.0.0.250. We have WebRTC running on 10.0.0.250, so when you type some chat domain you will get WebRTC in your browser.
2.	Search engines – these domains are going to be resolved to IP address 10.0.0.251 by unbound. We have Yacy running on 10.0.0.251, so when you type some search engine domain you will get Yacy in your browser.
3.	Social networks – these domains are going to be resolved to IP address 10.0.0.252 by unbound. We have Friendica running on 10.0.0.252, so when you type some social network domain you will get Friendica in your browser.
4.	Storage - these domains are going to be resolved to IP address 10.0.0.253 by unbound. We have Owncloud running on 10.0.0.253, so when you type some storage domain you will get Owncloud in your browser.
5.	Webmail - these domains are going to be resolved to IP address 10.0.0.254 by unbound. We have Mailpile running on 10.0.0.254, so when you type some storage domain you will get Mailpile in your browser.
6.	Blocking – this  group includes tracker, redirector, governmental, spyware domains. - these domains are going to be resolved to IP address 10.0.0.1 by unbound. We have Webmin running on 10.0.0.1, so when you type some storage domain you will get Webmin administration interface in your browser to allow/deny given domain
Step: 2  .onion domains resolution 
If incoming DNS request is for .onion domain then it will be forwarded To Tor DNS server running on 10.0.0.1:9053. Tor DNS server will resolve that request qithin Tor network and resolved ip address will be from 10.192.0.0/16 network.
Step: 3  .i2p domains resolution
If incoming DNS request is for .i2p domain then it will be resolved to ip address 10.191.0.1 by unbound.
Step: 4  Other domains resolution by DjDNS
If incoming DNS request in not in classified domains, nor is .onion neither .i2p then dns request will be forwarded to DjDNS server running on 10.0.0.1:8053
Step: 5  Other domains resolution by Tor + DNSSEC
This step is tacking place if DjDNS could not resolve other domains resolution request at step 4: This time DNS request again will be forwarded to Tor DNS server (10.0.0.1:9053) but this time with DNSSEC validation.

Unbound dns  configuration is implemented by configure_unbound() function. (lines 491-726 of app-configuration-script.sh) 
Tor dns configuration is implemented by configure_tor() function. (lines 411-474 of app-configuration-script.sh)

###Connection Flow 3: Squid Open SSL Tunnel

When user it's using a HTTPS connection to a darknet domain, this traffic it's considered as insecure.
On darknet domains, squid will open the SSL tunnel and inspect for possible exploits, virus and attacks to the user.
If this connection it's to a HTTPS regular domain, this SSL tunnel will be not open nor inspected. Will be routed directly to the internet (ex: https://yourbank.com)

###Connection Flow 4: Squid Content Filtering Virus & Anonymous HTTP Headers

Content filtering will be done if it's a HTTPS open SSL tunnel, or a regular HTTP petition.


Squid will do mainly two process of it.


- With I-cmp/clamav plugin, filter all possible viruses.

- Remove from HTTP headers all possible identification to you.
Connection Flow 5: IPS & Exploits: Suricata

If traffic it's a HTTPS open SSL tunnel (only in darknet domains), or a regular HTTP petition, then Suricata will inspect traffic, too.

Suricata will be configured with rules to avoid, mainly, browser exploits (usually in darknets, to take control of browser).

Loading VRT ruleset from snort and other IPS.

Connection Flow 6: Connection to Outside

If connection pass all blocks and Connection Flow filters, then this petition can reach the internet. Otherwise will be blocked. And will reach in this way

- I2P domains/eepSite (ex: i2p2.i2p) will be redirected to I2P

- SSL Regular domains (ex: https://yourbank.com) will reach te internet directly (remember no regular connections if you don't allow)

- Hidden services (ex: asdf1234.onion) will go through TOR

- HTTP (ex: http://news.com) will go through TOR to the internet site
Access from outside model (Bypass Router / Closed Ports

#app-configuration-script.sh (Parametrization script)**

It aims to configure all the packages and services.



1. Check User 
  * You need to run script as root user

2. Get variables
  * Get variables values defined by app-installation-script.sh

3. Configure network interfaces
  * External interface will be configured to get ip dinamically 
  * Internal interface will be configured with static ip address 10.0.0.1/24
  There are also 4 virtual interfaces
  * :1 10.0.0.251/24 for Yacy services
  * :2 10.0.0.252/24 for Friendica services
  * :3 10.0.0.253/24 for Owncloud services 
  * :4 10.0.0.254/24 for Mailpile services

4. Configure DNS resolution
  * Unbound DNS will be configured to listed 10.0.0.1:53
  * Tor DNS will be configured to listed 10.0.0.1:9053
  * DjDNS will be configured to listed 10.0.0.1:8053



##DNS resolution process.

###Classified domains
  * Search engines  - will be resolved to ip address 10.0.0.251 (Yacy) by unbound.
  * Social networks - will be resolved to ip address 10.0.0.252 (friendics) by unbound.
  * Storages        - Will be resolved to ip address 10.0.0.253 (Owncloud) by unbound.
  * Webmails        - Will be resolved to ip address 10.0.0.254 (MailPile) by unbound.
    
###Local, i2p and onion domains

  * .local - will be resolved to local ip address (10.0.0.0/24 network) by unbound.
  * .i2p   - will be resolved to ip address 10.191.0.1 by unbound.
  * .onion - unbound will forward this zone to Tor DNS running on 10.0.0.1:9053
   
###Other domain names

  * Any other domain name will be resolved by DjDNS,P2P or OpenNIC with CryptoDNS.

This wizard should ask the customer about and is pending in the project to be developed:
 -a) Do you want your protect your privacy or just user Librerouter services? if yes then mode bridge if not then mode equals server.
 -b) Mode Transparent firewall Bridge:
 -     Lets configure the Internet access (WAN)
 -     Do you want to conect your Librerouter to your Internet router via cable or WLAN?
 -         if WLAN
Please specify your internet router SSID Please specify your encryption methods WPA or WPA2 WEP not allowed no encryption not allowed Please specifiy your SSID password The daemon should check the conection getting up If not especify error conditions

if Cable:

*If Cable and DHCP:
Please specify if you would use fix IP or DHCP client? If DHCP Then setup dhcp client in the interface and try to receive IP The daemon should check the conection getting up If not especify error conditions

If Cable and FIX IP address:
*Please provide the IP address Please provide the default GW Please provide the DNS server Trying ping against the IPs If correct finish The daemon should check the conections answers If not especify error conditions

Lets configure the Internal access (LAN Intranet)
 -Do you want to setup your internal protected network via cable or WLAN?

If WLAN then:
 -Please specify your internal new WLAN name SSID Please specifiy your SSID WPA2 CCMP password The daemon should check the connection getting up If not especify error conditions The IP addresses are 10.0.0.1 forced (if the guy another then hack the box)

if Cable then:
 -Please be aware we use this internal range: 10.0.0.100 to 200 Gateway 10.0.0.1 and DNS
 -Please plug a cable Detecting link Link up Now your connected

c) Mode Server only WAN external bridge will be used and then all WLAN and ETH will be all 4 interfaces in the same Bridge NIC logical interface.Do you want to use a cable or want Librerouter connect to your router or switch?
